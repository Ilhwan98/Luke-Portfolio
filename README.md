# Luke-Project Repository
This is my repository for my data science projects that I am doing aside from my job.
Python is not my strong suit so this is just for practice! :)

# [Project 1: Haberman's Survival Dataset](https://github.com/Ilhwan98/Luke-Portfolio/blob/main/habermans-for-eda.ipynb)
* This project was made to predict the survivability of a patient after 5 years or treatment.
* Used this dataset to practice Exploratory Data Analysis
* Created analysis on the correlation between Age, Year of Treatment, number of lymph nodes and survivability
* Utilized matplotlib to plot data and create visualization


# [Project 2: Netflix Dataset](https://github.com/Ilhwan98/Luke-Portfolio/blob/main/netflix-analysis-dataset.ipynb)
* This project was made to predict which countries were producing the most content
* Data that might possibly affect future endeavors or projects for Netflix
* Possibly connect with IMDB data to connect tv show/movie ratings
